# My HackerOne Security Policy

This is the security policy for hackerone.com/ed. I am open-sourcing it in the hopes that more programs will be inspired by my work and to allow people from the community to contribute to my policy's contents. This project does not allow others to completely alter my threat model, it simply allows anyone to notify me of potential issues in the policy and how it could be improved.
